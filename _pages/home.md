**We are always open for new contributions from outside developers. If you want to contribute to this project, please visit the [CONTRIBUTING guide](/documentation/contributing/)**

Deep Learning Studio is a tool written in Python that helps you to build, train and test deep learning models. It is a modular tool which can be integrated with other JdeRobot projects. Popular use of Deep Learning Studio is to implement algorithms to be tested in Behavior Metrics.

This project aims to have a platform for evaluating and testing complex behaviors for different deep learning algorithms. This application is aimed to provide different implementations of notable algorithms and their variants.

This project presents different approaches to the already implementated algorithms and presents better versions of the algorithms.

You can see the project status in the [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DeepLearningStudio).
